The DSpace Services Framework provides the infrastructure of a more
componentized realization of DSpace.  Services, plugins, and providers
are registered with the framework so that they can find each other without
having to know each other too intimately.  This should make it easier to
maintain, extend, and understand DSpace as it evolves.
</p>

<p>The framework consists of:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>kernel</dt>
 <dd>initializes and starts the framework,
     grants ready access to core services</dd>
 <dt>service manager</dt>
 <dd>instantiates, configures, and controls services</dd>
 <dt>core services</dt>
 <dd>configuration, events, and the like</dd>
 <dt>utilities</dt>
 <dd>includes the DSpace object, a starting point in using the framework</dd>
</dl>

<p>
To use the Services Framework, start by creating a running kernel 
instance.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>In a standalone application, you can call {@link 
org.dspace.servicemanager.DSpaceKernelInit#getKernel} to get a reference 
to one.  Make certain that you call {@link 
org.dspace.servicemanager.DSpaceKernelImpl#start()} on it.  After that, 
everywhere you need a reference to that kernel, call {@link 
org.dspace.utils.DSpace#getKernel}.</li>
 <li>In a Spring container, you need to ensure that
{@code spring/spring-dspace-applicationContext.xml} and
{@code spring/spring-dspace-core-services.xml} are loaded.  Then you can
wire references to
  <ul>
   <li>{@code org.dspace.services.CachingService}</li>
   <li>{@code org.dspace.services.SessionService}</li>
   <li>{@code org.dspace.services.RequestService}</li>
   <li>{@code org.dspace.services.EventService}</li>
  </ul>
into your beans as needed.</li>
 <li>In a servlet container, you should configure a
{@link org.dspace.servicemanager.servlet.DSpaceKernelServletContextListener context listener}
to instantiate the kernel and a
{@link org.dspace.utils.servlet.DSpaceWebappServletFilter filter}
to establish the connection between the web application and the 
framework.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There can be multiple kernels in a single JVM.  I wish someone would 
update this paragraph to explain why you would want more than one.  Each 
kernel has a unique name established by 
{@code DSpaceKernelInit.getKernel(String)} and looked up by {@code new 
DSpace(String)}.
</p>
<p>If the name is {@code null}, this refers to the "default kernel".  
The zero-argument {@link org.dspace.utils.DSpace#DSpace()} constructor
is a convenient way to access the default kernel.  Unless you are doing 
something fancy, this is probably the only kernel you will ever need to 
think about.
